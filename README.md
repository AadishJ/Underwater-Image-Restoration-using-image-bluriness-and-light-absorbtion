This is my version of implementation regarding the IEEE paper Underwater Image Restoration using Image Bluriness and Light Absorption
I have done the implementation in python

I took inspiration from the MatLab implementation done by Jerry Peng
Both the github of Jerry Peng and the IEEE paper link are given below
